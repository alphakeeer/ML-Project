'''
Objective: Analyze and improve the models' performance.
Instructions
    1. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model trained in Part 3 (using confusion matrix).
    2. Draw ROC and calculate AUC for each model class.
    3. Improve each model via validation.
    4. Interpret the results to assess each model's strengths, weaknesses and possible improvements (e.g., determining whether the model overfits).
Deliverables
1. Calculated metrics, e.g., AUC and plotted ROC.
2. Description and interpretation of validation results.
3. Further discussion (100-200 words) of model performance based on metrics, ROC, AUC and so on.
