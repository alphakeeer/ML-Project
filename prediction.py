'''
Objective: Train supervised learning algorithms and assess its performance.
Train a simple machine learning model and assess its performance.
Instructions
    1. Choose a classification target (e.g. classification of a value).
    2. Choose at least two simple model classes (e.g., decision tree, logistic regression).
    3. Split the dataset into training (e.g., 70%) and testing (e.g., 30%) sets.
    4. Train the model classes on the training set.
    5. Test the trained model on the the training set, testing set and the entire set.
